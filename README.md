# Final Exam

## Girections

1. **DO NOT** touch the HTML.

2. All other girections are in 'scripts.js'

3. This is a **solo** coding assignment. If you do get any help from someone, be sure to mention them in a comment to make it clear what they helped you with.

## Grading

### 50 Points Total

You will be graded on:

1. Overall code quality and functionality. Use of ‘ES2015+’ syntax, `=>`, _destructuring_ and _default parameter values._ **If you try to copy code that you don’t understand, and do stuff like have `var`s in your code, I will immediately take at least 10 points off of the top.**

2. Quality of your `commit`s. Generally, you should have 1 `commit` as a minimum for every ‘girection’ (e.g. TODO). Many times, you can literally cut/paste my TODO as your commit message.

3. Quality of your comments to show that you understand what the code is doing. Again, you are not writing an essay - although, you may create a separate write up in a ‘long form’ document to show what you do understand, especially if you can’t get your code done and working (Slack DM this as a separate document - unless YK how to write MD files) - but do sprinkle in a sentence here or there to explain what you are doing. **Do not leave any of my comments in the code.**

## Get Started

**First and foremost,** make sure that your local machine is set up with all of the 'dev environment tooling' as per [this guide...](https://www.notion.so/codefinity/Setting-up-a-Local-Dev-Environment-for-JS-02a4e9f4a30043d3a8e7d109be3448f4)

After establishing your directory structure on your local machine, (e.g. '~/Code'), kindly [follow these girections](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) - essentially, there should be a button 👆🏾that says **Use this template.**

Once this repo has been created on your GitHub, you can click on the button to `clone` it as usual. Once it's `clone`d to your local machine, kindly `cd` into the directory and **be sure to do:** `npm i` to build out 'node_modules'. This will provide you with some helpful tooling and linting.

Now, enter `code .` to open this project in VS Code, and look for a prompt to 'install some extensions' once inside VS Code (in the bottom right of your screen). You should install these. 👍🏾
